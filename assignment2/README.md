In the wake of a natural disaster, scheduling relief tasks is essential. Volunteers and resources often rush to the affected area, but without proper coordination, the relief effort can quickly become disorganized and ineffective. By scheduling tasks, organizers can ensure that volunteers and resources are used efficiently, assigning individuals with specific skills to the most suitable tasks and directing supplies to where they are most needed. Scheduling relief tasks also ensures that support is sustained over time, as a surge of volunteers in the immediate aftermath may dwindle later on. This sustained effort is necessary for communities to receive consistent and necessary aid. Additionally, scheduling tasks provides structure and purpose to volunteers who may feel overwhelmed upon arriving in the disaster zone, allowing them to be more confident and productive in their relief efforts. Ultimately, scheduling relief tasks is critical in maximizing the impact of the relief effort and providing effective and sustainable support to the affected communities. In this assignment, as Hacettepe BBM and AIN students, you are supposed to help schedule relief efforts by using dynamic programming and greedy programming approaches. Assume that a list of tasks will be given to a team of volunteers. Some tasks will overlap and it will not be possible to finish all the tasks from the list. Therefore, the team needs a planner that will optimize the task schedule for maximum benefit.
